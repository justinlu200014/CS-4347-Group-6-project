The Student Recordkeeping Database Project encompasses creating a one-stop platform to help college students manage all aspects of their campus life â€” everything from academics to finances, housing, dining, and extracurriculars. As students ourselves, we understand that it can be overwhelming to juggle so many different systems, like academic portals, housing apps, and dining platforms. Our goal is to simplify the aforementioned difficulties by bringing students together in a single, easy-to-use platform. Unlike most systems that just focus on grades and academic performance, our platform covers everything that impacts student life, including clubs, events, meal plans, housing details, as well as finances.

Therefore, we created a full-stack web application with CRUD functionalities. The user, a college student, will be able to store, update, retrieve, and delete information about various facets of their college life. The user is prompted to log in with their Google Account, after which they are able to perform SQL queries (namely, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE) various entries in their database via our website.
