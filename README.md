# Student Recordkeeping Database Project  

The **Student Recordkeeping Database Project** is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to help college students manage every aspect of their campus life from a single platform.  

## Overview  
As college students, we understand how overwhelming it can be to juggle various systems for academics, housing, dining, finances, and extracurricular activities. This project aims to simplify that experience by consolidating everything into one easy-to-use platform.  

Unlike most systems that focus solely on grades and academic performance, our platform covers all facets of student life, including:  
- Academics  
- Finances  
- Housing details  
- Meal plans  
- Clubs and events  

## Features  
Our application provides full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to:  
- Store, update, retrieve, and delete information about various aspects of their college life.  
- Log in securely using their **Google Account**.  
- Perform **SQL operations** (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) directly through the platform.
